# no-rain-fog
removes rain and fog for the ones like me that cant stand it. (hopefully)
to install just replace the current weather folder inside C:\Jet-AIO\Server\db with this 1. and make sure to make a back up of the original incase of errors
once replaced go and delete your cache and rebuild it. as your cache pre-stores the old 1 when u first built it so it will use that instead of this (i think still learning.)
